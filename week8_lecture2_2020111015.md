# Polynomial time reductions and NP completeness theory
## Class NP: Polynomial time verifiable languages
  - A verifier for a language A is an algorithm V, where A = {w| V accepts (w, c) for some string c}.
  - We measure the time of a verifier only in terms of the length of w, so a polynomial time verifier runs in polynomial time in the length of w.
  - A language A is polynomially verifiable if it has a polynomial time verifier.
## Class NP
  - NP is the class of languages that have polynomial time verifiers
  - NP is the set of decision problems for which the problem instances, where the answer is "yes", have proofs verifiable in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine
  - It is easy to see that the complexity class P (all problems solvable, deterministically, in polynomial time) is contained in NP (problems where solutions can be verified in polynomial time)
  - This is because if a problem is solvable in polynomial time then a solution is also verifiable in polynomial time by simply solving the problem
## Examples of Languages in NP
  ### CLIQUE = {(G, k)| G is an undirected graph with a k-clique}.
   - PROOF
   - The following is a verifier V for CLIQUE.
   - V = “On input ((G, k), c):
   - Test whether c is a set of k nodes in G
   - Test whether G contains all edges connecting nodes in c.
   - If both pass, accept; otherwise, reject."
  ### SUBSET-SUM = {(S, t)| S = {x1, ..., Tk} and for some {yı, ..., yı} C {x1, ..., Tk}, we have Ey; = t}.
   - PROOF The following is a verifier V for SUBSET-SUM.
   - V = “On input ((S, t), c):
   - Test whether c is a collection of numbers that sum to t.
   - Test whether S contains all the numbers in c.
   - If both pass, accept; otherwise, reject."
## NP vs Co-NP
- Observe that the complements of these sets, CLIQUE and SUBSET-SUM, are not obviously members of NP. 
- Verifying that something is not present seems to be more difficult than verifying that it is present.
- We make a separate complexity class, called CO NP, which contains the languages that are complements of languages in NP.
- We don't know whether coNP is different from NP.

P = class of languages for which membership can be decided quickly
NP = class of languages for which membership can be verified quickly<br><br>

## Polynomial time reducibility
  - A function f : sigma* →sigma* is a polynomial time computable function if some polynomial time Turing machine M exists that halts with just ƒ(w) on its tape, when started on any input w.
  - Language A is polynomial time mapping reducible, or simply polynomial time reducible, to language B, written A <=p B, if a polynomial time computable function f: sigma* → sigma* exists, where for every w,
		       w belongs to A <=> f(w) belongs to B.
  - The function f is called the polynomial time reduction of A to B.
  - if A <=p B and B belongs to P, then A belongs to P
  - On input w:
  1. Compute f(w)
  2. Run M on input f(w) and output whatever M outputs
  ### 3SAT is polynomial time reducible to CLIQUE<br>

  #### PROOF
   - Let ø be a formula with k clauses such as
   - ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbg_white%20%5Cphi%20%3D%20%28a_1%20%5Cvee%20b_1%20%5Cvee%20c_1%29%5Cwedge%20%28a_2%20%5Cvee%20b_2%20%5Cvee%20c_2%29%20%5Cwedge%20...%20%5Cwedge%28a_k%20%5Cvee%20b_k%20%5Cvee%20c_k%29)<br>
   - The reduction f generates the string <G, k>, where G is an undirected graph defined as follows.
   - The nodes in G are organized into k groups of three nodes each called the triples, t1, ..., tk.
   - Each triple corresponds to one of the clauses in ø, and each node in a triple corresponds to a literal in the associated clause.
   - Label each node of G with its corresponding literal in ø<br><br>

   - The edges of G connect all but two types of pairs of nodes in G. 
   - No edge is present between nodes in the same triple and no edge is present between two nodes with contradictory labels, as in x2 and ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbg_white%20%5Cbar%7Bx_2%7D).
   -  The figure illustrates this construction when ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbg_white%20%5Cphi%20%3D%20%28x_1%20%5Cvee%20x_1%20%5Cvee%20x_2%29%5Cwedge%20%28%5Cbar%7Bx_1%7D%5Cvee%5Cbar%7Bx_2%7D%5Cvee%5Cbar%7Bx_2%7D%29%5Cwedge%28%5Cbar%7Bx_1%7D%20%5Cvee%20x_2%20%5Cvee%20x_2%29)
   - Now we demonstrate why this construction works. We show that o is satisfiable iff G has a k-clique.
   - Suppose that phi has a satisfying assignment. In that satisfying assignment, at least one literal is true in every clause.
   - In each triple of G, we select one node corresponding to a true literal in the satisfying assignment.
   - If more than one literal is true in a particular clause, we choose one of the true literals arbitrarily.
   - The nodes just selected form a k-clique. The number of nodes selected is k, because we chose one for each of the k triples.
   - Each pair of selected nodes is joined by an edge because no pair fits one of the exceptions described previously.
   - Suppose that G has a k-clique. 
   - No two of the clique's nodes occur in the same triple because nodes in the same triple aren't connected by edges.
   - Therefore each of the k triples contains exactly one of the k clique nodes.
   - We assign truth values to the variables of ø so that each literal labeling a clique node is made true.
   - Doing so is always possible because two nodes labeled in a contradictory way are not connected by an edge and hence both can't be in the clique.
   - This assignment to the variables satisfies ø because each triple contains a clique node and hence each clause contains a literal that is assigned TRUE.
   - Therefore ø is satisfiable.

## Definition of NP completeness
  - A language B is NP complete if it satisfies two conditions:
  1. B is in NP, and 
  2. Every A in NP is polynomial time reducible to B.
