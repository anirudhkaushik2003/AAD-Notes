## Edit distance
 - Edit distance between two words is defined as the minimum number of insert/delete/ overwrite operations to convert one word into another
 - A natural measure of the distance between two strings is the extent to which the can be _aligned_ , or matched up
 - Consider the following example:<br>

 - In the above case we perform 2 inserts, 2 insertions and one overwrite

 - In the above case we perform 1 insert, 1 delete and 1 overwrite
 - Clearly the second case is better, there are multiple optimal answers in this case
 - Thus we can see , that the cost of the alignment is the number of columns in which the elements differ
 - The edit distance, is thus the cost of the best possible alignment of the 2 strings
 ### Naive solution
  - The naive solution of going through all possible alignments and choosing the best one fails miserably
  - The reason is that there are infinitely many possible alignments and hence it is not possible to go through all of them
 ### Dynamic programming solution
   - We need to find the edit distance between 2 strings x[1...m] and y[1...n]
   - Let E(i,j) be the edit distance some prefix of x and y, lets say first i characters of x and first j characters of y
   - We can see now that we require E(m,n)
   - Each subproblem is E(i,j) for 1<=i<=m and 1<=j<=n
   - We need to appropriately order the subproblems as a DAG to be able to use Dynamic programming to find the edit distance between x and y
 ### Modelling E(i,j) as a sub problem
   - The right most column i.e. the last operation on the prefix of the strings x and y can be one of 3 things
      1. Insert (x[i] and -)
      2. Delete (- and y[i] )
      3. Update (x[i] and y[i])<br>

   - Thus the corresponding recursions will be the following respectively
   ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbg_white%20E%28i%2Cj%29%20%3D%20min%5C%7B1&plus;E%28i-1%2Cj%29%2C%5C%201&plus;E%28i%2Cj-1%29%2C%5C%20diff%28i%2Cj%29&plus;E%28i-1%2Cj-1%29%5C%7D)<br>
   - This is because incase we have to insert we just have to add 1 for this operation and consider the remaing i-1 elements of x and remaing j elements of y
   - Similary for delete we have to consider remaining j-1 elements of y and i elements of x
   - For the case of update, since both x and y are being changed, the number of operations are diff(i,j) (diff = 0 if x[i] = y[j] and 0 otherwise) and then we consider the remaing i-1 elements of x and j-1 elements of y
   - We notice that the answers to all the subproblems can be arranged as a table as follows:<br>
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71220864/134714227-c28dc2a9-c76e-45dd-a414-cdb9ce42e744.png)<br><br>
   - Notice that we need to first determine the order in which to solve the problems: E(i-1,j), E(i,j-1) or E(i-1,j-1) before solving E(i,j) in order to have the appropriate result available at the time of computations
   - The column 1,1 will be easy to fill as it does not require any other information and we might recurse backward till we reach this step
   - In case of an iterative solution, this can be the 1,1 element of the mxn matrix of answers 
 ### Algorithm
   ```
   for i = 0,1,2,...,m:
     E(i,0) = i - Initialize indexes
   for j = 0,1,2,...,n:
     E(0,j) = j - Initialize indexes
   for i = 0,1,2,...,m:
     for j = 0,1,2,...,n:
       E(i,j) = min{1+E(i-1,j), 1+E(i,j-1), diff(i,j)+E(i-1,j-1)} - Formula we derived earlier
   return E(m,n) - return the answer
   ```
 ### Example: Edit distance between EXPONENTIAL and POLYNOMIAL
   - Consider the following 11x10 matrix:<br>
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71220864/134715607-65d8d507-8af8-4d71-89f4-c2f7fd320e89.png)<br><br>
   - The optimal alignment will look as follows:<br>
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71220864/134715661-9453ac6d-4c1e-4831-80c5-94f5eb0b5435.png)<br><br>
 ### Underlying DAG
   - Since this is a DP problem, in order to be able to solve it we need to arrange the sub problems as vertices of a DAG
   - The following is the DAG for our example<br>
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71220864/134716677-6a04c75f-cd89-4dc3-9412-142ee29d1727.png)<br><br>
   - As we can see the above DAG has a path of length 6 which is the optimum cost for the edit length of the given strings
   - This is the path our algorithm takes when calculating E(m,n)
 ### Analysis
   - The analysis in this case is fairly simple
   - Looking at the pseudo code for our algorithm, for given strings x[1...m] and y[1...n] of lengths m and n respectively there is one nested for loop iterating over both of them
   - Hence the complexity using DP is O(m,n)
