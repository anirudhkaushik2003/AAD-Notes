## Shortest Reliable Path
  ### Problem
  - Suppose then that we are given a graph G with lengths on the edges, along with two nodes s and t and an integer k, and we want the shortest path from s to t that uses at most k edges.
  - Shortest path is the path that has the least sum along its edge weights
  - In networking packets may get dropped at routers because of congestion, if we are taking k+1 or more hops then there is a chance that the package may not reach the destination at all, or may reach the destination with very low reliability.
  - Thus we need to look for the shortest reliable path with the least number of hops. We limit the number of hops to k.
  - If the graph contains n edges then we will never take more than n hops.
  - If k is of the order n, then the number of paths of length k will be the value of s,t in the adjacency matrix raised to the power k.
  - To reach the paths with length atmost k we need to sum up which will be exponential with respect to k.
  ### Subproblems
  - Let i <= k, dist(v,i) to be the length of the shortest path from s to v that uses i edges.
  - i can vary upto k and v can have n different value, hence this will have the order nk which is manageable.
  - We define dist(v,i) recursively as follows:<br>
  ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbg_white%20dist%28v%2Ci%29%20%3D%20%5Cmin_%7B%28u%2Cv%29%20%5Cin%20E%7D%5C%7Bdist%28u%2Ci-1%29%20&plus;%20l%28u%2Cv%29%5C%7D)<br>
  - The above equation is quite intutuive. The distance from s to v that uses at most i edges is the minimum distance from s to a node u that takes i-1 edges plus the distance from from node u to v.
  - Once we find dist(u,i-1) for all the neighbors of v then we will be able to obtain dist(v,i)
  - Similarly we will be able to obtain dist(t,i) and we will take the minimum among these such that i is at most k.
  ### Optimization  
  - Multiple nodes may have the same neighbors and hence we may calculate dist(u,i-1) multiple times
  - Hence we use memoization to calculate each result only once and this significantly reduces the time complexity.
  
## All pair shortest Path Floyd Warshall algorithm
  ### Problem
  - Get the shortest path between any two nodes in O(|V^3|) time where V is the number of vertices
  - This cannot be used for negative edge weights as if there exists a negative edge weight cycle, once we enter the cycle, we will keep traversing the cycle and hence get stuck in it.
  ### Subproblems]
  - Let dist(i,j,k) denote the length of the shortest path from i to j in which only {1,2,...,k} nodes can be used as intermediates
  - We can define this dist recursively as follows:<br>
  ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbg_white%20dist%28i%2Cj%2Ck%29%20%3D%20%5Cmin%5C%7Bdist%28i%2Ck%2Ck-1%29%20&plus;%20dist%28k%2Cj%2Ck-1%29%2C%20dist%28i%2Cj%2Ck-1%29%5C%7D)<br><br>

  - Two cases arise: We can either use the kth node or not use it
  - In case we do not use the kth node, dist(i,j,k) becomes the minimum distance from i to k in k-1 nodes plus the minimum distance from the kth node to j in k-1 nodes.
  - In case we do not use the kth node, dist(i,j,k) becomes dist(i,j,k-1)
  - The minimum of these 2 is the actual dist(i,j,k)
  ### Algorithm
  ```c
for i = 1 to n :
	for j=1 ton :
		dist(i,j,0) = infinity
for all (i,j) € E:
	dist(i,j.0) = (i,j)
for k =1 to n:
	for i =1 to n:
	  for j =1 to n:
		  dist(i, j,k) = min{dist(i,k, k – 1) + dist(k, j,k – 1), dist(i,j,k– 1)}
  ```
## Independent Set in Trees
  - A subset of nodes S of V is an independent set of graph G = (V,E) if there are no edges between them.<br><br>

  ## Problem 
  - What is the largest Independent Set given a Tree T
  ### Subproblems
  - Define I(u) = size of largest independent set of sub-tree hanging from u
  - There are only 2 possibilities: either u belongs to the independent set or it doesn't
  - We can describe I(u) recursively as follows:<br>
  ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbg_white%20I%28u%29%20%3D%20max%5C%7B1&plus;%20%5Csum_%7Bgrandchildren%20%5C%20%22w%22%20%5C%20of%20%5C%20%22u%22%7DI%28w%29%2C%20%5Csum_%7Bchildren%20%5C%20%22w%22%20%5C%20of%20%5C%20%22u%22%7DI%28w%29%5C%7D)<br>
  - We do this level by level in a BFS and we can climb from child to parent till we get to the root node so that we have both the above values ready by the time we reach a given node.
  - Thus in this manner we can find the largest independent set in a given tree T.
