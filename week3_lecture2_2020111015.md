## Greedy Algorithms
### Minimum Spanning Tree
##### Kruskals Algorithm
  - Uses a greedy approach
  - Start with an empty graph and repeatedly add next lightest edge that doesn't produce a cycle
  - When a greedy stratergy gives a correct solution, it is hard to beat it in terms of complexity
  - There are times when a greedy approach doesn't work as local optimum doesn't always lead to global optimum
  #### Cut Property
   - Suppose x edges are part of a minimum spanning tree of G = (V,E). Pick any subset of nodes S for which X
     does not cross between S and V-S, let e be the lightest edge across this partition. Then X U {e} is part of some MST
   - If X forms an MST then you cannot pick such an S
   - Using cut propert we will prove that Kruskal's works properly
   #### Proof
   - Start with X whose edges are part of some MST T
   - We add the lightest edge e across S and V-S not in T
   - We construct a different MST T' which is formed using XU{e}, if e is already part of T then the theorem is vacuously true
   - Add e to T and this will create a cycle having another edge e' between S and V-S as T is an MST
   - if we remove e' then we will be left with T' = T U {e} - e' which will show to be a tree
   - T' is a tree since removing a cycle edge cannot disconnect a graph<br>

   - Also T' has the same number of edges as T since we added an edge and removed an edge so it is also a tree
     (any connected graph with n-1 edges has to be a tree)
   - weight of e cannot be less than e' as T was an MST and e cannot be larger than e' as it would be a contradiction
   - thus e must be equal to e'
   - weight of T' = weight of T since
     weight(T') = weight(T) + w(e) - w(e')
  - Kruskal's Algorithm is based on cut property and hence we can infer that it is correct as we always pick the smallest weight edge which does not create a cycle
  - Kruskal's Algorithm's pseudo code is given below<br>

  - For a graph G = (V,E) complexity is: |V| for makeset, |2E| for find, (|V|-1) union operations

##### Disjoint set data structure<br><br>

    ```javascript
    function makeset(x)
    pi(x) = x
    rank(x) = 0
    ```<br>
  `parent pointer pi`<br>
  - Rank is the height of the subtree hanging from that node

    ```javascript
    function find(x)
    while x != pi(x) : x = pi(x)
    return x
    ``` 
  ```javascript
  function union(x,y)
  rx= find(x)
  ry = find(y)
  if rx = ry: return
  if rank(rx) > rank(ry):
    pi(ry) = rx
  else:
    pi(rx) = ry
    if rank(rx) = rank(ry): rank(ry) += 1
  ```
  - make the root of the shorter tree point to the root of the taller tree
  #### Properties of rank
   - Property 1: for any x, rank(x) < rank(pi(x))
   - Property 2: Any root node of rank k has atleast 2^k nodes in its tree
   - if there are n elements overall, there can be atmost n/2^k nodes of rank k
   - A root node of rank k is created by merger of two trees of rank k-1
   - this extends to internal(non root) nodes as well. Any node of rank k has atleast 2^k descendants.
  - Overall complexity:
   1. Makeset: O(1)
   2. Find: O(logN)
   3. Union: O(logN)
   4. Total: O((|E|+|V|)log|V|)
  #### Path compression
   - we sort the edges in order of weight
  #### Modifying Find
   - During each find, when a series of parent pointers is followed up to the root of the tree, we will change all these pointers so that they point directly to the root
   ```javascript
   function find(x)
   if x != pi(x): pi(x) = find(pi(x))
   return pi(x)
   ```
   - The time taken by  specific find is the number of pointers followed
   - ranks are divided into log* n intervals

   - nodes x on the chain to root fall into 2 categories
     1. either the rank of the parent is in a higher interval than the rank of x
     2. it lies in the same interval
   - There are atmost log* n nodes of the first type
   - each time its parent is of the first type
     1. its parent changes to one of higher rank
     2. therfore if x's rank lies in the interval {k+1,...,2^k}, it is of this type atmost 2^k times before its parent rank is in a higher interval whereupon it is never of the second type again

#### Summary
  - Kruskals algorithm usig=ng disjoint set data structures with path compression runs with complexity:
    "sorting |E| elements" + O(|E|log*|V|)
