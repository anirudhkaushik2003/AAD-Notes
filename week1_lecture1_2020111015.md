## Introduction to AAD
### computational problems 
  - In theoretical computer science, a computational problem is a problem that a computer might be able to solve or a question that a computer may be able to answer. For example, the problem of factoring
  - A computational problem can be viewed as an infinite collection of instances or cases together with a, possibly empty, set of solutions for every instance/case
### The art of solving computational problems

### Np class of problems
  #### Np complete problems
  - it is a problem for which the correctness of each solution can be verified quickly and a brute-force search algorithm can actually find a solution by trying all possible solutions.
  - the problem can be used to simulate every other problem for which we can verify quickly that a solution is correct. In this sense it is the hardest of the problems to which solutions can be verified quickly so that if we could actually find solutions of some NP-Complete problem quickly, we could quickly find the solutions of every other problem to which a solution once given is easy to check.
  #### Np hard problems
  - In computational complexity theory, NP-hardness (non-deterministic polynomial-time hardness) is the defining property of a class of problems that are informally "at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP". A simple example of an NP-hard problem is the subset sum problem

### Problems as membership queries in languages
  - We can model each problem as a decision problem
  - It can be reduced to a problem for which a given input belongs to a particular set of answers for which the answer is yes
  - This reduces a highly complex problem to a problem whose output is yes or no

### Axioms of computation
  - It takes non zero time to retrieve data from far off locations
  - Only finite information can be retrieved/ stored in a finite volume
  - A finite length instruction only exerts finit amount of control<br>

### Comparing various solutions

- We can compare solutions by analysing their worst case, average case and best case analysis
- some algos may have better average time which may be more desirable for a particular scenario
- Some algos may be better depending on input size
- Hence we compare algorithms based on a variety of scenarios and choose the one which is the best for the given situation
