## Efficient quantum algorithm for integer factorization
 - Factoring is reduced to finding a non trivial square root of 1 modulo N
 - Finding such a root is reduced to computing the order of a random integer modulo N
 - The order of an integer is precisely the period of a particular pereodic superposition
 - Finally, periods of superposition can be efficiently found by quantum FFT

 ### Step-1: Factoring and non trivial square root of 1 modulo N
 - Lemma 1: if x is a non trivial square root of 1 modulo N, then gcd(x+1,N) is a non trivial factor
 - x^2 = 1 mod N implies that N divides (x^2-1) = (x+1)(x-1)
 - x != +- 1 mod N
 - Therefore N must have a non trivial factor in common with each of (x+1) and (x-1)
 - Example let N = 15. Then 4^2 = 1 mod 15 but 4 != +- 1 mod 15.
 - both gcd(4-1,15) = 3 and gcd(4+1,15) = 5 are non trivial factors of 15
 
 ### Step-2: reducing non trivial square root of 1 modulo N to computing the order of modulo N
 - order(x) is the smallest positive integer r such that x^r = 1 mod N
 - choose a random x. Assume gcd(x,N) = 1
 - if r, the order of x is even then a non trivial square root of 1 is x^r/2
 - if x = 2 and N = 15 then the order of 2 is 4 since 2^4 = 1 mod 15. 
 - So we get a divisor of 15 by computing gcd(4+1,15) = 5

 ### Step-3: the order of an integer is precisely the period of a particular pereodic superposition
 - f(a) = x^a mod N
 - if r is the order of x, then f(0) = f(r) = f(2r) = .. = 1
 - f(1) = f(r+1) = f(2r+1) = ... = x
 - thus f is pereodic with period r
 - n qubits = superposition of their 2^n possible states<br><br>

 - Measure the second register. This gives a pereodic superposition on the first register with period r, the period of f

 #### Finding the period via fourier transform:
 - Lemma: suppose s independent samples are drawn uniformly from 0,M/k,M/2k,...,(k-1)M/k
 - Then with probability atleast 1-k/2^s, the greatest common divisor of these samples is M/k
 
 ### FFT Algorithm:
 ```java
 function FFT (a,w)
 Input: An array a = (a0,a1,...,an-1) for n power of 2
        A primitive root of unity
 Output: Mn(w)a
 
 if w=1: return a
 (s0,s1,...,s(n/2-1)) = FFT((a0,a2,...,an-2),w^2)
 (s'0,s'1,...,s'(n/2-1)) = FFT((a1,a3,...,an-1),w^2)
 
 for j = 0 to n/2 -1:
    rj = sj + w^js'j
    rj+n/2 = sj - w^js'^j
 return (r0,r1,...,rn-1)
 ```

## Summary
 - Input: an odd composite integer N
 - Output: a factor of N
 1. choose x uniformly in the range 1 <= x <= N-1
 2. Let M be a power of 2 near N
 3. repeat s = 2 logN times
   - start with 2 quantum registers both initially 0, the first large enough to store a number modulo M and the second modulo N
   - Compute f(a) = x^a mod N using a quantum circuit to get the superposition of ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbg_white%20%5Csum_%7Ba%3D0%7D%5E%7BM-1%7D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csqrt%20M%7D%7Ca%2Cf%28a%29%5Crangle), where f(a) = x^a mod N
   - Measure the second register. Now the first register contains the pereodic superposition |a> = ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbg_white%20%5Csum_%7Bj%3D0%7D%5E%7BM/r-1%7D%20%5Csqrt%20%5Cfrac%7Br%7D%7BM%7D%7Cjr%20&plus;%20k%5Crangle) where k is a random offset between 0 and r-1 (recall that r is of the order x modulo N).
   - Fourier sample the superposition |alpha> to obtain an index between 0 and M-1
   - let g be the gcd of the resulting indices j1,...,js

 4. If M/g is even, then compute gcd(N,x^M/2g + 1) and output if it is a nontrivial factor of N; otherwise return to step 1.
