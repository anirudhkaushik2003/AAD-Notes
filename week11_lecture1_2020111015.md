# Some more examples of proving NP completeness<br>Assuming 3-SAT is NP complete
## Vertex cover problem
  - If G is an undirected graph, a vertex cover of G is a subset of the nodes where every edge of G touches one of those nodes.
  - The vertex cover problem asks whether a graph contains a vertex cover of a specified size: vertex cover  = {(G, k)| G is an undirected graph that has a k-node vertex cover}.
  - VERTEX-COVER is NP-complete.
  ### PROOF Here are the details of a reduction from 3SAT to VERTEX-COVER that operates in polynomial time.
   - The reduction maps a Boolean formula ø to a graph G and a value k. 
   - For each variable x in ø, we produce an edge connecting two nodes. We label the two nodes in this gadget x and x̄ Setting x to be TRUE corresponds to selecting the left node for the vertex cover, whereas FALSE corresponds to the right node.
   - triple of three nodes that are labeled with the three literals of the clause. These three nodes are connected to each other and to the nodes in the variables gadgets that have the identical labels. 
   - Thus the total number of nodes that appear in G is 2m + 3l, where ø has m variables and l clauses. Let k be m + 2l.
   - For example if ø = (x1 V x1 V x1)  (x̄1 V x̄2 V x̄2) ∧  (x̄1 V x2 V x2), the reproduction produces <G,k> from ø, where k = 8 and G takes the form shown in the figure:<br><br>

   - In the above, we connect every node from the bottom band to a similarly labelled node , x1 to x1, x2 to x2 etc.
   - In the top band there are m disjoint edges and in the bottom band there are l triangles, thus there are 2m + 3l nodes.
   - To prove that this reduction works we need to show that ø is satisfiable if and if G has a vertex cover with k nodes. We start with a satisfying assignment.
   - We first put the nodes of the variable gadgets that correspond to the true literals in the assignment into the vertex cover.
   - Then, we select one true literal in every clause and put the remaining two nodes from every clause gadget into the vertex cover.
   - Now, we have a total of k nodes. They cover all edges because every variable gadget edge is clearly covered, all three edges within every clause gadget are covered, and all edges between variable and clause gadgets are covered.
   - Hence G has a vertex cover with k nodes.
   - Second, if G has a vertex cover with k nodes, we show that ø is satisfiable by constructing the satisfying assignment.
   - The vertex cover must contain one node in each variable gadget and two in every clause gadget in order to cover the edges of the variable gadgets and the three edges within the clause gadgets.
   - That accounts for all the nodes, so none are left over.
   - We take the nodes of the variable gadgets that are in the vertex cover and assign the corresponding literals TRUE.
   - That assignment satisfies ø because each of the three edges connecting the variable gadgets with each clause gadget is covered and only two nodes of the clause gadget are in the vertex cover.
   - Therefore one of the edges must be covered by a node from a variable gadget and so that assignment satisfies the corresponding clause.

## The Subset Sum Problem
  - Subset sum = {<S,t>| S = {x1,x2,...,xk} and for some {y1,...,yl} ⊆ {x1,x2,...,xk}, we have Σyi = t}
  ### Subset sum is NP complete
   - a 3cnf-formula ø we construct an instance of the subset sum problem that contains a subcollection summing to the target t if and only if ø is satisfable.
   - Call this subcollection T.
   #### Proof
   -  Let ø be a boolean variable with variables x1,...,xl and clauses c1,...,ck 
   -  The reduction converts ø to an instance of the subset problem <S,t>
   -  The table is partially filled to illustrate sample clauses c1,c2 and ck<br><br>

   - Thus S contains one pair of numbers, yi, zi, for each variable xi in ø. The decimal representation of these numbers is in two parts, as indicated in the table.
   - The left-hand part comprises a 1 followed by l – i 0s.
   - The right-hand part contains one digit for each clause, where the jth digit of yi is 1 if clause cj contains literal xi and the jth digit of zi is 1 if clause cj contains literal x̄i.
   - Digits not specified to be 1 are 0.
   - Additionally, S contains one pair of numbers, gj, hj, for each clause cj.
   - These two numbers are equal and consist of a 1 followed by k – j 0s.
   - Finally, the target number t, the bottom row of the table, consists of l 1s followed by k 3s.
   - Suppose that ø is satisfiable. We construct a subset of S as follows.
   - We select yi if xi is assigned TRUE in the satisfying assignment and zi if xi is assigned FALSE.
   - If we add up what we have selected so far, we obtain a 1 in each of the first l digits because we have selected either yi or zi for each i.
   - Furthermore, each of the last k digits is a number between 1 and 3 because each clause is satisfied and so contains between 1 and 3 true literals.
   - Now we further select enough of the g and h numbers to bring each of the last k digits up to 3, thus hitting the target.
   - Suppose that a subset of S sums to t. We construct a satisfying assignment to ø after making several observations.
   - First, all the digits in members of S are either 0 or 1. Furthermore, each column in the table describing S contains at most five 1s.
   - Hence a “carry" into the next column never occurs when a subset of S is added.
   - To get a 1 in each of the first l columns the subset must have either yi or zi for each i, but not both.
   - Now we make the satisfying assignment.
   - If the subset contains yi, we assign xi TRUE; otherwise, we assign it FALSE.
   - This assignment must satisfy ø because in each of the final k columns the sum is always 3.
   - In column cj, at most 2 can come from gj and hj, so at least 1 in this column must come from some yi or zi in the subset. 
   - If it is yi, then xi appears in cj and is assigned TRUE, so cj is satisfied. 
   - If it is zi, then x̄i appears in cj and xi is assigned FALSE, so cj satisfied. 
   - Therefore ø is satisfied.
