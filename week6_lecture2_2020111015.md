## Chain Matrix Multiplication 
  ### Problem
  - multiplying an mxn matrix with an nxp matrix takes mnp steps
  - Our aim is to come up with a method of parenthisizing the input matrices such that the cost of multiplication is minimum
  - consider 4 matrices A,B,C,D of size 50x20, 20x1, 1x10 and 10x100 respectively
  - Costs:
  ```
  Ax((BxC)xD) = 20.1.10 + 20.10.100 + 50.20.100 = 120,100
  (Ax(BxC))xD = 20.1.10 + 50.20.10 + 50.10.100 = 60,200
  (AxB)x(CxD) = 50.20.1 + 1.10.100 + 50.1.100 = 7,000
  ```
  - Clearly the last parenthisization is better than the first 2
  - Our objective is to design an algorithm to achieve this minimum
  ### Modeliing the multiplication sequences as binary trees

  - In the above manner, we display the order of multiplication in the form of a binary tree
  - To make this overall tree optimum, we need to make every subtree optimum
  ### Subproblems
  - Let C(i,j) = min cost of multiplying Ai x A(i+1) x A(i+2) x ... x Aj
  - C(i,i) = 0<br>
  ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbg_white%20C%28i%2Cj%29%20%3D%20%5Cmin_%7Bi%5Cleq%20k%20%3C%20j%7D%5C%7BC%28i%2Ck%29%20&plus;%20C%28k&plus;1%2Cj%29&plus;m_%7Bi-1%7D*m_k*m_j%5C%7D)<br>
  - In the original problem we need to find C(1,n)
  - In order to find C(i,j) we need to find C(i,k) for every k >= i and k < j, i.e., all the previous columns in the same row
  - Hence we can find every diagonal value first as we already have the values for C(i,k) and C(k+1,j) ready
  ### Algorithm
  ```c
  for i = 1 to n: C(i,i) = 0
  for s = 1 to n-1:
    for i = 1 to n-sL
      j = i+s
      C(i,j) = min{C(i,k) + C(k+1,j) + m_{i-1}.m_k.m_j: 1 <= k < j}
  return C(1,n)
  ```
  - Solving the subproblems in this way has the DAG property
  ### Analysis
  - The subproblems constitute a 2d table, each of whose entries takes O(n) time to compute
  - The overall running time is therefore O(n^3)
  
 ## Knapsack
  ### Problem
  - During a robbery a burglar found much more loot than expected and decides what to take
  -  His bag (or knapsack) can hold at most W units of weights
  - There are n items to take with weight w1,w2,...wn and dollar value v1,v2,...,vn respectively
  - What is the most valuable combination he can fit into his bag with repitition?
  ### Subproblems
  - Let K(w) = maximum value achievable by a knapsack of capacity w
  - We can express this in the form of subproblems as follows<br>
  ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbg_white%20K%28w%29%20%3D%20%5Cmax_%7Bi%3Aw_i%20%5Cleq%20w%7D%20%5C%7B%20K%28w-w_i%29%20&plus;%20v_i%20%5C%7D)<br>
  - We need to express K(w) in terms of K of smaller values of w
  - if we do this we'll be able to find K(W)
  ### Algorithm
  ```c
  K(0) = 0
  for w = 1 to W:
    K(w) = max{K(w-wi)+vi: wi <= w}
  return K(W)
  ```
  ### Analysis
  - For large value of weight, weight can be expressed in logw bits
  - In terms of input size which is logw bits, this is an exponential complexity problem
## Knapsack without repitition
  ### Subproblems
  - K(w,j) = max value achievable by using a knapsack of capacity w with items 1,2,...,j
  - Each item is either needed to achieve optimum or not needed<br>
  ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbg_white%20K%28w%2Cj%29%20%3D%20%5Cmax%5C%7B%20K%28w-w_j%2C%20j-1%29%20&plus;%20v_j%2C%20K%28w%2Cj-1%29%20%5C%7D)<br>
  - If an item is needed then it is the first case of the above equation and if it is not needed then it is the second part of the above equation
  ### Algorithm
  ```c
  Initialize all K(0,j)=0 and all K(w,0) = 0
  for j = 1 to n:
    for w = 1 to W:
      if wj > w: K(w,j) = K(w,j-1)
      else: K(w,j) = max{K(w,j-1, K(w-wj,j-1) + vj}
  return K(W,n)
  ```
  ### Analysis
  - The complexity for solving knapsack is O(nW)
  - The input size is n+logW for large W
  - In terms of n+logW, n* logW is an exponential algorithm in logW
  - Thus this isn't an efficient solution
  - Knapsack is an np class problem

This concludes the notes for this lecture, some additional resources may be added for my personal reference on a later date
