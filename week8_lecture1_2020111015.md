# Primality Testing
  - Given an input number p, we wish to find out whether p is prime or not
## Miller-Rabin Randomized test
  - Def: A witness for n is any number 1 <= a < n such that a is co prime to n and either a^(odd(n-1)) = 1 mod n or a^(odd(n-1)2^i) = -1 mod n for some i >= 0
  - Consider a hard problem for which there are no efficient algorithm to solve it
  - However there exist several efficient algorithm A1, A2, A3...,Ak such that there are atleast 2k/3 values of i for which Ai correctly solves the problem
  - A degree of randomness is used as part of the logical procedure for randomized algorithm in the hope of achieving good performance in the average case
  - The algorithm:
  PRIME = On input p:
    - If p is even, accept if p = 2 otherwise reject
    - Select a1,a2,...,ak randomly in Zp+
    - For each i from 1 to k:
      - Compute ai^(p-1) mod p and reject if it is different from 1
      - Let p-1 = st where s is odd and t = 2^h is a power of 2
      - compute the sequence ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbg_white%20a_i%5E%7Bs.2%5E0%7D%2Ca_i%5E%7Bs.2%5E1%7D%2Ca_i%5E%7Bs.2%5E2%7D%2C...%2Ca_i%5E%7Bs.2%5Eh%7D) modulo p.
      - If some element of this sequence is not 1, find the last element that is not 1 and reject if that element is not -1
    - All tests have been passed at this point so accept

  - Thus this method tells us whether a given number is prime or not
  ### Proof
  #### If P is an odd prime number ,Probability(PRIME accepts p) = 1
  - We first show that if p is prime, no witness exists and so no branch of the algorithm rejects
  - If a were a stage 4 witness, (a^(p-1) mod p) != 1 and Fremat's little theorem implies that p is composite.
  - If a were a stage 7 witness, some b exists in Zp+, where b != +-1 mod p and b^2 = 1 mod p 
  - Therefore b^2-1 = 0 mod p. Factoring b^2-1 yields (b-1)(b+1) = 0 mod p
  - Which implies that (b-1)(b+1) = cp for some positive integer c.
  - Because b != +-1 mod p, both b-1 and b+1 are strictly between 0 and p.
  - Therefore p is composite because a multiple of a prime number cannot be expressed as a product of numbers that are smaller than it is
  
  #### If p is an odd composite number, Probability(PRIME accepts p) <= 2^-k (negligible for large k)
  - We show that if p is an odd composite number and a is selected randomly in Zp+ Proba(a is a witness) >= 1/2
  - We do this by demonstrating that atleast as many witnesses as nonwitnesses exist in Zp+, we do so by finding a unique witness for each nonwitness
  - In every nonwitness, the sequence computed in stage 6 is either all 1s or contains -1 at some position followed by 1s
  - For example, 1 itself is a non witness of the first kind, and -1 is a non witness of the second kind because s is odd and (-1)^(s.2^0) = -1
  - Similarly -1^(s.2^1) = 1.
  - Among all nonwitnesses of the second kind, find a nonwitness for which the -1 appears in the largest position in the sequence
  - Let h be that nonwitness and let j be the position of -1 in its sequence, where the sequence positions are numbered starting at 0.
  - Hence h^(s.2^j) = -1 mod p
  - Because p is a composite number, either p is a power of a prime or we can write p as the product of q and r, two numbers that are relatively prime.
  - We consider the latter case first.
  - The chinese remainder theorem implies that some number t exists in Zp whereby 
            t = h mod q and t = 1 mod r
  - Therefore:<br>
  ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbg_white%20t%5E%7Bs.2%5Ej%7D%5Cequiv%20-1%5C%20mod%5C%20q)<br>
  ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbg_white%20t%5E%7Bs.2%5Ej%7D%5Cequiv%201%5C%20mod%5C%20r)<br>
  - Hence t is a witness because t^(s.2^j) != +- mod p but t^(s.2^(j+1)) = 1 mod p
  - Now that we have one witness, we can get many more
  - We prove that dt mod p is a unique witness for each non witness d by making two observations.
  - First d^(s.2^j) = +- 1 mod p and d^(s.2^(j+1)) = 1 mod p owing to the way j was chosen
  - Therefore dt mod p is a witness because (dt)s.2^j != +- 1 and (dt)^(s.2^(j+1)) = 1 mod p
  - Second, if d1 and d2 are distinct nonwitnesses, d1t mod p != d2t mod p. 
  - The reason is that t^(s.2^(j+1)) mod p = 1.
  - Hence t.t^(s.2^(j+1)-1) mod p = 1. Therefore if td1 mod p = td2 mod p then <br>
  ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbg_white%20d_1%20%3D%20t.t%5E%7Bs.2%5E%7Bj&plus;1%7D-1%7Dd_1%5C%20mod%5C%20p%20%3D%20t.t%5E%7Bs.2%5E%7Bj&plus;1%7D-1%7Dd_2%5C%20mod%5C%20p%20%3D%20d_2)<br>
  - Thus the number of witnesses must be as large as the number of nonwitnesses, and we have completed the analysis for the case where p is not a prime power.
  - For the prime power case, we have p = q^e where q is prime and e > 1. Let t = 1+q^(e-1)
  - Expanding t^p using the binomial theorem we obtain:<br>
  - t^p = (1+q^(e-1))^p = 1 + p.q^(e-1) + multiples of higher powers of q^(e-1), which is equivalent to 1 mod p.
  - Hence t is a stage 4 witness because if t^(p-1) = 1 mod p then t^p != 1 mod p
  - As in the previous case, we use this one witness to get many others
  - if d is a non witness, we have d^(p-1) = 1 mod p, but then dt mod p is a witness
  - moreover if d1 and d2 are distinct nonwitnesses, then d1t mod p  != d2t mod p.
  - Otherwise d1 = d1.t.t^(p-1) mod p = d2.t.t^p-1 mod p = d2
  - Thus the number of witnesses must be as large as the number of nonwitnesses, and the proof is complete

#### Note:
This lecture was purely theoretical and hence the notes are similar to sir's slides since it was difficult to find better and shorter proofs online
