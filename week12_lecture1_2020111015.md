## An Experiment with photons (the three polarizers)
 - If you pass ordinary light through a horizontal polarizer A then about 50% of the photons pass through
 - If you add a vertical polarizer after A to the above setup then no photons pass through
 - If you pass the light through A then through a 45deg polarizer B then through C then about 1/8 of the photons pass through<br><br>

 - This was bizzare because since 2 polarizers completely blocked the light adding additional polarizers should have the same effect
 - But in this case the number of photons increased as compared to when only A and C were used
 - In addition, if light is polarized arbitrarily, then how come 50% of the photons pass through A alone.
 - We expect only a negligible amount of photons to pass through since only a small amount are expected to be horizontally polarized

## Qubits
 - In simple systems, where there are only 2 outcomes we call it a qubit, for instance the photon can pass through or it cannot pass through
 - This is the simplest non trivial system
 - Mathematics says that if there are 2 outcomes then the superposition of both of these will be the actual outcome. 
 - Similarly for higher number of possibilities the actual outcome will be the superposition of all of these
 - A quantum bit or a qubit is a unit vector in a 2D complex vector space for which a particular basis has been fixed and denoted by:
   ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbg_white%20%5C%7B%7C0%5Crangle%2C%20%7C1%5Crangle%5C%7D)<br>
 - qubits can be a superposition of |0> and |1> such as:
   ![eqaution](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbg_white%20a%7C0%5Crangle%20&plus;b%7C1%5Crangle)<br>
 - where a and b are complex numbers such that |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1
 - for the qubit a|0> + b|1> the probability that the measured value is |0> is |a|^2 after which the state collapses to |0>
 -  the probability that the measured value is |2> is |b|^2 after which the state collapses to |1>

## Qubit model correctly predicts the Outcome of the photon experiment
 - For a photon with a|0> + b|1> where 0 is for passing through the vertical and b time not passing through the vertical (i.e. passing through the horizontal)
 - The probability that it will pass through the vertical is |a|^2, so the expected value of a should be equal to b as the polarisations are random
 - Hence since |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1 and a = b then probability that it will pass through should be 50%
 - for the second part, given that the photon passes through the polarizer, it will collapse to horizontal and due to this it cant pass through the vertical polarizer.
 - This is because the photons that could pass through the horizontal were the ones that couldnt pass through the vertical
 - when we have a 45deg polarizer midway, 50% will pass through the horizontal polarizer, all these 50% collapse to horizontal
 - Now the probability that these photons will pass through B is: either it can pass through or it can't pass through which will be ((1/2)^0.5)^2 = 1/2
 - Now these photons will collapse to 45deg. 
 - Now the prob that these photons will pass through vertical polarizer C is again 1/2
 - Thus total prob = 1/2*1/2*1/2 = 1/8

### Superposition postulate
 - State vector in Hilbert space, Tensor analysis
### Measurement and Collapse postulates
 - projections, inner products etc.
### Evolution postulate
 - Schrodinger equation, Unitary Transformations etc.

### No cloning theorem
 - Assume that U is a unitary transformation in that U(|a0>) = |aa> for all quantum states |a>
 - Consider |c> =(1/root2)(|a> + |b>)
 - then U(|c0>) = |cc> = 1/root2(|aa> + |ab> + |ba> + |bb>)
 - a contradiction

## Multiple Qubits
 - Individual state spaces of n particles combine classically through the cartesian product
 - Quantum states however combine through the tensor product
 - A basis for a 3 qubit system is {|000> |001> |010> |011> |100> |101> |110> |111>}
 - An n qubit system will have a 2^n basis vectors
 - The reality will be the superposition of all 2^n states

## Quantum Entaglement
 - The state |00> + |11> cannot be described in terms of its components (qubits) separately.
 - We cannot find a1,a2,b1,b2 such that (a1|0> + b1|1>)X(a2|0> + b2|1>) = |00> + |11>
 - Means a1b2 = 0  which implies that either a1a2 = 0 or b1b2 = 0
 - States which cannot be decomposed in this what are called entagled states<br><br>

## Quantum Teleportation
 - The objective is to transmit the quantum state of a particle using classical bits and reconstruct the exact quantum state at the receiver.
 - Does not contradict no-cloning theorem<br><br>

 - When Bob receives the two classical bits from Alice he knows how the state of his half of the entangled pair compares to the original state of Alice's qubit.
 - Bob can reconstruct the original state of Alice's qubit, 4, by applying the appropriate decoding transformation to his part of the entangled pair as follows:<br><br>
