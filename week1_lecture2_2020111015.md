# Week 1, lecture 2
## Summary 
We learnt about problems as membership queries in language and proved that there are uncountably many problems for which programs do not exist
## Details
### Problems as membership queries in languages
#### Total number of computer programs is countably infinite
  - The set of finite length bit strings {0,1}* is countable
    - We prove this by listing all the strings in short-lex order and then mapping them with natural numbers as follows:<br>

    - Thus since in this order every string has to occur once and occurs at most once, this is a bijection
    - Hence, the set is countably infinite
    - We can similarly conclude that every computer program can be represented as a finite length binary string and hence there exists a 
      bijection between the set N and the set of of all computer programs. Thus the set of all computer programs is countably infinite.

#### Number of computational problems is uncountable infinite
  - Using the relation between a computer program and a finite length bit string as defined above we can define a problem as a subset of the set of all
    possible binary strings, every subset is a different problem as a problem can give multiple bits as output,we consider each bit output as a separate problem
  - The one bit output problems are called decision problems, every problem can be stated as a decision problem where the input belongs to the set of all inputs
    where the answer is 1.
  - The decision problems can be restated as - given an input x does the input belong to the set of all inputs that give the output 1.
  - We use this to define a bijection from the set of all computational problems to the space of subsets of {0,1}*
  - That subset is the set of all inputs for which the answer will be yes or 1.
  - Thus the total number of problems is the cardinality of the power set of the set of all binary strings.
  - We use the diagonalization technique as cantor to prove the power set of {0,1}* 
  - We map every subset in P{0,1}* to {0,1}, 1 if the element is in the subset and 0 if the element is not in the subset.
  - thus every problem can be encoded as an infinite length binary string where the ith bit represents whether the ith string in short lex order is in the subset or not.
  - cantor's diagonalization method proves that the set of infinite length binary sequences is not countable.
  - hence a bijection with set N does not exist and the set of all problems is uncountably infinite.

#### from the above 2 we can see that there are computational problems that the computer cannot solve as the set of computer programs is countably infinite but the set of all problems is uncountably infinite and hence a bijection between them cannot exist. 

#### There are many problems that are practically useful but unsolvable. Eg- the program equivalance problem that checks whether 2 programs solve the same problem.

### Church Turing Hypothesis
#### Attributes of machines:
  - machines are not omnipresent and it takes non zero time to retrieve information from far off locations
  - a finite length code only exerts finite amount of control
  - only finite information can be stored in a finite amount of volume

### The turing machine
  - it is said to be the simplest programming language
  - Tm is a 7 tuple<br>

  - if we populate all these 7 tuples we would have written a computer program
  - there should be one end of file symbol which is not part of the input alphabet set to signify the end of input
  - The tape should be able to store atleast one more symbol than the input alphabet symbol
  - if we are in the control state Q and we read some symbol gamma then we move to state Q' and we overwrite the symbol and move either left or right
  - this is the transition function and is the only instruction in the turing machine
  - if we get invalid input we enter the reject state
  - c programs are turing complete, if no c program exists then no machine/algorithm exists
