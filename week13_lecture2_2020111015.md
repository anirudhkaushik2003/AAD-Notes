# Byzantine Agreement
 - The Byzantine Agreement protocol is a protocol in distributed computing
 - The Byzantine army was divided into divisions with each division being led by a General with the following properties:
  - Each General is either loyal or a traitor to the Byzantine state.
  - All Generals communicate by sending and receiving messages.
  - There are only two commands: attack and retreat.
  - All loyal Generals should agree on the same plan of action: attack or retreat.
  - A small linear fraction of bad Generals should not cause the protocol to fail (less than a 1/3 fraction).
 - The problem usually is equivalently restated in the form of a commanding General and loyal Lieutenants with the General being either loyal or a traitor and the same for the Lieutenants with the following properties.
  - All loyal Lieutenants carry out the same order.
  - If the commanding General is loyal, all loyal Lieutenants obey the order that he sends.
  - A strictly less than 1/3 fraction including the commanding General are traitors.

 - Each process starts with an input from a fixed set V = {0,1}.
 - The goal is for the players to eventually output decisions from the set V upholding the following conditions, even in the present of an adversary that can byzantinely corrupt upto any t of the n players:
  1. Agreement: All non faulty processes decide on the same value u belong to V
  2. Validity: if all non faulty processes start with the same initial value u in V then u = v
  3. Termination: all non faulty processes eventually decide<br><br>

## Impossibility results
 - Let ùë° be the maximum number of faulty processes that our protocol is
supposed to tolerate
 - Byzantine agreement is not possible with fewer than 3ùë° + 1 processes (less than 1/3 should be corrupt)
 - Consider a commander giving lieutenant L1 to attack and lieutenant L2 telling L1 to retreat<br><br>

 - L1 doesnt know whether commander or L2 is the traitor
 - In case commander is loyal and tells both to attack and L2 is a traitor and tells L1 to retreat:<br><br>

<br><br>
 - Here L1 must obey the commander and attack
 - In case commander is a traitor and tells L1 to attack and tells L2 to retreat:<br><br>

 - Here L1 must follow L2 and retreat
 - the problem is that there is no way for L1 to distinguish between the above two cases
 - Hence, no solution with fewer than 3m+1 generals can cope with m traitors

## Protocol for 1 out of 4
 - The procedure consists of exchange of messages, followed by computation of interactive consistency vector on the basis of result of exchange.
 - Two round of information exchange is required:
    1. In the first round the processors exchange their input values.
    2. In the second round they exchange all the values obtained in the first round.<br><br>

## Authenticated Byzantine agreement
 - Processes are supplemented with "magical powers" to authenticate their communication ‚Äì Digital Signatures.
 - Pease et. al showed that using authentication, fault tolerance can be increased to t< n.

## Connnectivity challenge
 - In a (synchronous) P2P network of n nodes, t of which are (Byzantine) faulty, consensus/agreement is possible only if the network is (2t + 1)-connected.
 - With cryptography: (t + 1)-connectivity is sufficient.<br><br>

## Round complexity challenge
 - In a (synchronous) P2P network of n nodes, t of which are (fail-stop / Byzantine) faulty, consensus requires >t rounds, in the worst case.

## Other methods of consensus 
 - Blockchain method
 - Quantum byzantine agreement
